GR_NFM_ARCHIVE is a GNU Radio component for capturing Narrowband FM radio signals, decoding, and storing them on disk by frequency range and date in WAV format. with Software Defined Radio Hardware such as Airspy, RTL_SDR, HackRF. (I am currently using OSMOSDR so whateaver is supported by them should work)
